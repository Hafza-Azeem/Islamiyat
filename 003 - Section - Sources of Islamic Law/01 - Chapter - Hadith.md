It is the indirect word of Allah and is always in line with the Quranic teachings. Therefore it is also divine.

It clarifies and explains the meaning of Holy Quran there fore hadith is the extension of Holy Quran.

It is used when the Holy Quran is silent upon a matter.

The great scholar Al-Shafi stated:
***"The Sunnah and the word of Allah never contradict with eachother."***

The Holy Prophet (PBUH) life was
a practical demonstration of his teachings as Hazrat Ayesha (R.A) has said:
***"His habits were accordance with the Holy Quran."***

***Approval:***

The Holy Quran approves the use of hadith in the following words:

***"O you who believe! obey Allah and obey the messenger and those who are charged with authority among you and if  you differ in anything amongst yourselves then refer it to Allah and his messenger if you believe in Allah and the last day."***

Here the phrase "obey the messenger" refers to the use of hadith as
source of Islamic Law and guidance.

preparations are not mentioned in the Holy Quran.This has been explained by the hadith of the Prophet (PBUH)
who has said:
***"Pray as you see me praying."***
