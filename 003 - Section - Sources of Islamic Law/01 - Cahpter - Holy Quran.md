#### Topic: Holy Quran as a source os islamic laws

#### Q.How do Muslim scholars/Muslims use the Holy Quran as a source of Islamic Law/in Islamic Legal thinking/in making Islamic laws? [10] 18:40 (8laws).

***Introduction:***

The Holy Quran was revealed upon the Holy Prophet (PBUH) through angel Jibrael over a period of 23 years  (from 610-632AD). 

It is the first source of Islamic Law and is a primary source 

The Holy Quran is universal, eternal and for all times to come. It is a perfect divine book which will never be
changed as Allah himself has taken the responsibility to protect it as the Holy Quran says:
***"Surely We have revealed this reminder (The Holy Quran) and no doubt We will protect it (from corruption)."***

***Importance of The Holy Quran:***

Since the Holy Quran is the first and primary source of
Islamic Law, Muslims accept its teachings without
any doubt.

It is unchangable/unamendable due to its divine nature.

It guides. Muslims both individually and communally
complete code of life covering different aspects
for example religious, social, political, economic, military, Judicial etc as the Holy Quran says:
***"We have revealed to you (o Muhammad) the book (Holy Quran) an exposition of everything."***
 
The Holy Quran is an independent source whereas all
other Sources like hadith, Ijma and Qiyas are dependent
upon it. That is why they cannot make a law against Quran. 

***Approval:***

The Holy Quran approves the use of Quran as a source in
the following words:
***"O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the messenger and those who are charged with authority among you and if you differ in anything amongst yourselves then refer it to Allah and His messenger if you believe in Allah and the last day"***

Here the phrase "obey Allah" refers to the orders of Allah laid down in the obedience in the Holy Quran.

This verse also approves the use of hadith, lima and qiyas.

***Tafseer and Muffassir:***

Tafseer is the interpretation /explaination/clarification of the Holy Quran whereas Muffassir is the one who. interprets, explains or clarifies the Quran

Following the demise of the Holy Prophet (PBUH), Muslims felt that there was a need for the clarification of Quranic verses which were difficult to understand. Therefore the Science  of Tafseer was  discovered Muslims came to know that the best explaination of Quran was by the Quran itself for example Surah- al-Maidah verse 1 says:
***"Lawful to you are all beasts of cattle with the
exceptions named..."***
In this verse the the Quran  does not explain the exceptions the exceptions are not outlined but later in the third surah, Quran explains the exceptions are not verse of the same which the earlier verse was referring to This principle is called, Tafseer-al-Quran-bil-Quran (clarification of the Holy Quran by the Quran) 

Sometimes the Holy Quran is explained/clarified by the hadith of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) for example the method of prayer. This principle is called Tafseer-al- Quran- bil-hadith (clarification of Quran by the Holy Prophet (PBUH)).

***Examples of Islamic Law:***

***Law #1:***

The Holy Quran outlines the fulfillment of pillars of
Islam that are fasting, zakat, prayer etc. It says:
***"Establish a prayer and practise charity..."***
This verse orders the fulfillment of two faraiz namely
zakat and prayer which have to be fulfilled in order
to have a strong relationship with Allah.

***Law #2:***

The Holy Quran outlines the punishment of crimes like theft in the following words: 
***"For the theif. male or female cut off his or her hand"*** 
The reason for this apparently strict punishment is that a persons property is sacred and cannot be taken
without his or her permission.

***Law #3:***

Similarly the Holy Quran outlines the punishment of
adultery/fornication in following word:
***"Woman and man guilty of fornication, flog each of
them with a 100 strikes"***
This is because adultery is an immodest act whereas Islam promotes modesty and purity.

***Law #4:***

The Holy Quran explains the treatment of non-Muslims by
saying:
***"Let there be no compulsion in religion."***
Thus Muslims are ordered to respect other religions as Islam is a universal religion which respects the rights of every one.

***Law#5***

The Holy Quran ban's riba(interest on loan) in the following words:
***"Allah has allowed trade, but has forbidden riba"***
This is because riba is a way to exploit the weak conditions of the poor. 

***Law #6:***

Allah orders Muslim's to be most humble and polite towards their parents as they make maximum sacrifice for their children. The Holy Quran says:
***"And treat your parents with utmost kindness."***

***Law #7:***

The Quran promotes democracy as it says:
***"Who (the believers) decide their matters through mutual consultation"***
This shows that Islam promotes democracy and rejects.
dictatorship.

Law #8:
The Holy Quran orders Muslims to act respectfully.
especially in the presence of opposite genders. It says:

***"And say to the believing men;***

***To Lower their gaze and guard their modesty;***

***And say to the believing women;***

***To Lower their gaze and guard. their modesty."***

***Law #9:***

The Holy Quran tells Muslims about the division of
property of a deceased person among his children for
example for sons and daughters it says: 

***"The male should recieve a portion equal to that of two females;***

***If there are only daughters, two or more, they should receive 2/3rd (two-third) of the inheritance;***


***If there is only one daughter, her share is half."***

Males have been given a greater portion than females
because they have to look after their family 
financially.

***Law #10:***

Allah orders Muslims to vage physical jihad against the
enemies of Islam and suppress their aggression as the 
Holy Quran says:

***"Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight you, but do not exceed Limits."***

***Law # 11:***

Islam stresses upon justice strictly even if it goes 
against a person himself or his family, as the Holy 
Quran says:
***"O you who believe! be staunch in justice as a 
witness to Allah even if it goes against you, your 
parents or nearest relatives..."***

This means that Islam promotes justice and condemns
favouritism.

#### Topic: Compilation of the Holy Quran:

#### Q. Describe how the Holy Quran was compiled during the time of Hazrat Abu-Bakr and Hazrat Usman. [10]

***Introduction:***

The Holy Prophet (PBUH) could not read or write. 
Whenever a revelation was revealed upon him through 
angel Jibrael he conveyed them to scribes who wrote 
them down on anything they could find for example bones.
Leaves, pieces of pottery, Leather etc. The Holy Quran 
was completed till the Holy Prophet (PBUH) death but was
not written down in one copy.

***Hazrat Abu-Bakr:***

The first caliph Hazrat Abu Bakr experienced many
difficulties. One of the major problems was fals.
prophets and the worst among them was Musaylima
Hazrat Abu-Bakr fought against him in the battle of
at the Garden of Death. Although Muslims won
battle and Musaylima was killed, many Muslims who
had memorised the Quran were killed. Hazrat Umar
then suggested Hazrat Abu-Bakr to make a written
collection of the Quran. He worried that if more
huffaz were killed in future battles, the word of Allah
might be lost. Hazrat Abu-Bakr did not want to do this
because he was hesitant as the Prophet (PBUH)
had not done it. Hazrat Umar persuaded him and so he
asked, Hazrat Zaid-bin-Sabit (the prophets chief scribe/
secretary) to do his work. He was hesitant at first but
eventually agreed. Hazrat Zaid was under a lot of 
pressure and stress as he himself said the it would be
easier to carry a mountain on his back than to compile
the holy quran as he was aware that for this he would
be answerable to Allah on the day of judgement. He 
worked hard along with the other scribes and at last
found all parts of the Quran. The collection was made
and was given to Hazrat abu bakr. After his death it
was passed onto Hazrat Umar the second caliph. And
when he died in 644A.D, this copy was passed onto his
daughter Hazrat Hafsa whi kept it safe for a very
long time therefore this copy of the Quran is known
as Mashaf-e-Hafsa (Hafsa's copy of the Quran.) 

***Hazrat Usman:***

At the time of Hazrat Usmans caliphate (the third 
caliph), the muslim empire had expanded a lot.Many 
people from different areas with different languages 
and backgrounds (not arabic)excepted islam. Hazrat
usman came to know through his commanders Hazrat 
Anas and Hazrat Huzaifa taht some of these people were 
reciting Quran differently from the arabs and were also 
reading some words incorrectly. Hazrat Usman feared 
that the true Quran might be lost so he ordered Hazrat 
zaid-bin-Sabit to compile an authentic version of the 
Quran in Quraish dialect which was the the dialect of 
the Holy Prophet (PBUH). So Hazrat Zaid completed this 
task along with the other senior Muslims In the end 
they double checked this new version with 
Mashaf-e-Hafsa. Hazrat Usman sent copies of the 
original Quran to parts of the Empire and ordered that 
all the other copies should be burned so that only the 
correct word of Allah should be recited. This is the 
same Quran we read today.

#### Q. What is the significance to Muslims today of having the Holy Quran in book form? (4)

Having the Holy Quran in book form ensures a standard
copy which reduces the chances of it being reproduced
with errors.

If the Quran had not been compiled into book form,
parts of it may have been lost 

It promotes unity within Muslims as they read the
same book in the same language in the same dialect

Copies can be carried by individuals and refered to
with ease.

#### Q. Why did the rightly quided Caliphs/the first Muslim Community think it was important to compile the Holy Quran? [4]

When many memorizers of the Quran (huffaz) were martyred
in the battle of Yamama, Hazrat Abu Bakr upon the
insistence of Hazrat Umar realised that the Quran could
not be kept in the memory of huffaz alone. If in future
battles more huffaz were killed, the word of Allah might
be lost. Therefore he felt that it was important to
compile the Quran into a book form to preserve the word
of Allah for future generations, although he was aware
that the Holy Prophet (PBUH) had not done  this job.

When Hazrat Usman was told that the Holy Quran was
being recited in different dialects by different 
Muslims, he realised that this could result in loss of 
the original meaning of the Quran and would create 
disunity among the Muslim Ummah. Hence for providing 
Muslims with a single source of authentic guidance, he 
ordered for an authentic version of the Quran to be 
completed in Quraish dialect.

#### Topic: Ways in which the Holy Quran was revealed

#### Q.Describe the ways in which the holy quran was revealed between 610-632 A.D. [10]

***Introduction***

With age and growing understanding, the Holy Prophet 
(PBUH)became more aware of the corrupt Arabian society
around him. He often thought about the god of his
ancestors (Hazrat Ibrahim and Hazrat Ismail)

In his late thirties the Prophet (PBUH) became fond of
solitude and started retiring to the care of Hira with
are food and water. He would meditate there and ponder
over the true gods.

***Event of First Revelation:***

One day towards the end of Ramazan in 61OAD when
the Prophet (PBUH) was 40 years old, the angel Jibrael
appeared. before him and asked him to read. The
Prophet (PBUH) replied:

***"I cannot read."***

upon which the angel squeezed: the Prophet (PBUH) SO
hard that He (PBUH) felt that he would die of 
suffocation 

This procedure was repeated thrice after which the

The prophet (PBUH) asked: 

***"What shall I read." ***


Then the angel revealed the first 5 verses of
Surah-Alaq:

***"Read in the name of your Lord, who created;***

***Created man out of a mere clot of congealed blood;***

***Read! and your Lord is the Most Bountiful;***

***He who taught men (the use of pen);***

***Taught men which he knew not. "***

This marked the beginning of revelations. These verses
were imprinted upon the Holy Prophet's heart and
mind there and then 

From then onwards the Holy Prophet (PBUH) kept 
receiving revelation's for 23 years. These revelation 
were out of his control as he had no idea when they
were coming.

***Surah kausar:***

Surah Kausar says:

***"We have granted you the abundance;***

***therefore turn to your Lord in prayer and sacrifice;***

***for he who hates you will be cut off."***

These verses were revealed when the Holy Prophet (PBUH)
was passing through a period of great difficulty.The
Quraish had turned against him due to his propagation.
of Islam and when his second son died in infancy,
they called him ***"abtar"*** (a man cutoff from the.
community).

Hence this Surah was revealed upon the Holy Prophet 
(PBUH)to console him and to fore-tell the destruction of
his enemies.

***Surah-al-Anfal:***

Another example is of Surah-al-Anfal which was
revealed after the battle of Boon. It says:

***"And remember when you met;***

***He showed them to you as few in your eyes;***

***And made you appear contemptable in their eyes;***

***So that Allah might accomplish a matter already decreed"***

The rest of the surah gives an account of the battle of
Badr, which was fought in 624 AD. Muslims were.
out numbered 3 to 1 however Muslims won this battle with
the help of Allah.


***Makki and Madni Surahs:*** 

Those revelations were then compiled into two types of
Surahs that are Makki and Madni Surahs.

Makki Surahs were revealed upon the Prophet (PBUH) 
before his migration to Madina, and Madni Surahs were 
revealed upon the Prophet (PBUH) after his migration.

***1. Makki Surahs:***

Makki Surahs are generally brief.

They deal with beliefs in Allah and other articles of
faith.

They contain teachings to develop one's moral character.

They have strong vocabulary

They usually start with the phrase:
***"O you Mankind."***

They stress upon the importance of Taqwa (fear of 
Allah), His powers and His knowledge.

Surah Ikhlas is an example of a Makki Surah which
stresses upon the concept of Tauheed.

***2. Madni Surahs:***

Madni Surahs are generally longer.

They deal with pillars of Islam, social, economic, 
political, military judicial obligations of a Muslim.

They usually start with the phrase:
***"O you who believe!"***

Surah Maida is an example of a Madini Surah as 1pt
contains social Laws for example food laws.

***Sensations:***

Whenever a revelation came to the prophet (PBUH), he
experienced different sensations. He said that the
hardest on him was the ringing of bells. 

Hazrat Ayesha narrated that some times he would
perspire in severe cold.

At one occasion the prophet (PBUH) was sitting with
his leg on the leg of Hazrat Zaid-bin- Sabit and
a revelation came upon him. Hazrat Zaid revealed
that the Prophet (PBUH) became so heavy that he felt 
his leg would be crushed under the weight of Holy 
Prophet (PBUH) leg.

Sometimes angel Jabrael would appear before the Prophet
(PBUH)in the form of a human.

Sometimes angel Jabrael would appear in his original 
form.

The entire Quran was revealed through angel jabrael 
except for one occasion when the holy prophet(PBUH) 
received a revelation directly from Allah i.e on the 
journey of Mairaj Allah revealed the last 5 verses of 
Surah Bakrah upon the holy prophet (PBUH) directly.

Sometimes the holy prophet (PBUH) received revelations 
in his dreams.

These revelations put a lot of stress on the Prophe  
(PBUH) which is one of the reasons why the entire Quran 
was not revealed all at once.

***Last revelation:***

The Last revelation was revealed upon the Prophet(PBUH)
in the plain of Arafat After he(PBUH) had delivered 
the last sermon of Hajj. It says:
***"This day I have perfected your religions for you;
completed my favors upon you and have chosen islam as 
your religion."***
Through this Allah completed Quran and the religion of
islam.

***Brief description of how the Quran was revealed:***

The Holy Prophet (PBUH) could not read or write so when 
a revelation was revealed upon him through angel 
Jibrael his scribes wrote them on any surface they could find for example animal bones, leaves, leather, 
piece of pottery etc.

Some companions also memorised these verses. The Prophet
(PBUH) then counter checked by asking them to read out these verse to him.

memorise these revelations.

#### Topic: First Revelation:

#### Q. Describe the event of the first revelation. [10]

***Introduction:***

During the Holy Prophet's late 303 he started retiring
to the cave of Hira and used to meditate there. He that  would ponder over the true god that is the god of 
his ancestors Hazrat Ibrahim and Hazrat Ismail.

***Description:***

One day in 6LOAD when he (PBUH) was 40 years old!
and meditating in the cave of Hira, a being appeared
before him who was Later recognized as angel Jibrael!

He asked the Holy Prophet (PBUH) to read. However
the Prophet (PBUH) replied:

***"I cannot read, "***

Then the angel squeezed him so hard that he (PBUH) felt that he would die out of suffocation. When the angel
released him he asked again:

***"read"***

Then the Prophet (PBUH) again replied:

***"I cannot read."***

The angel squeezed him again.

This procedure was repeated thrice after which the
Prophet asked: 

***"What shall read?"***

Upon this response the angel revealed the first 5 Verses of Surah-al-Alaq:

***"Read in the name your Lord, who created;***

***Created man out of a mere clot of congealed;***

***Read and your Lord is the most Bountiful;***

***He who taught men (the use of pen)."***

***Taught men which he knew not."***

This was the first revelation
in the history of Islam and these words were imprinted upon the prophets heart
When he (PBUH) came out of the cave of hira he saw angel
Jibrael covering the entire horizon. Angel Jibrael now
said:

***"O Muhammad! you are the messenger of Allah and l am Jibrael."***

When the angel, disappeared the Holy Prophet (PBUH)
rushed to his house in a state of stress and anxiety
He asked his wife Hazrat Khadija to cover him as trembling with fear.

when the trembling was over he narrated the
entire incident to Hazrat Khadija and said:

***"I fear for myself."***

However she comforted him by saying:

***"Never by Allah, Allah, will never disgrace you
because you keep good relations with your kith and
kin, you help the poor and the needy, you serve your
guests generously and assists those deserving one's
who are affected by calamities."***

Then she took him to her cousin Warqa-bin- Naw fil
who was a Christian scholar and had good knowledge of the previous books. when he heard what the Prophet had to say he comforted him by saying that he (PBUH) had been visited by the angel same who had visited the previous prophets like Hazrat Isa, Hazrat Musa etc.

He also informed him that the Makkans will mistreat him, will turn against him and might also
expel him

The Prophet (PBUH) was suprised to hear this
as he had excellent relations with the Makkans. Out of surprise he asked:

***"Will they expel me?"***

Warqa responded that all previous prophets had been
persecuted by their nations and he (PBUH) would be no
exception.

Warqa also promised to support the Prophet (PBUH) mission however, he died four days later.

This event has been narrated by the Prophet (PBUH)
himself and is quoted by Imam Bukhari in his book
Sahih Bukhar
