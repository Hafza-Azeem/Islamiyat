#### Q.How do Muslim scholars/Muslims use the Holy Quran as a source of Islamic Law/in Islamic Legal thinking/in making Islamic laws? [10] 18:40 (8laws).

***Introduction:***

The Holy Quran was revealed upon the Holy Prophet (PBUH) through angel Jibrael over a period of 23 years  (from 610-632AD). 

It is the first source of Islamic Law and is a primary source 

The Holy Quran is universal, eternal and for all times to come. It is a perfect divine book which will never be
changed as Allah himself has taken the responsibility to protect it as the Holy Quran says:
***"Surely We have revealed this reminder (The Holy Quran) and no doubt We will protect it (from corruption)."***

***Importance of The Holy Quran:***

Since the Holy Quran is the first and primary source of
Islamic Law, Muslims accept its teachings without
any doubt.

It is unchangable/unamendable due to its divine nature.

It guides. Muslims both individually and communally
complete code of life covering different aspects
for example religious, social, political, economic, military, Judicial etc as the Holy Quran says:
***"We have revealed to you (o Muhammad) the book (Holy Quran) an exposition of everything."***
 
The Holy Quran is an independent source whereas all
other Sources like hadith, Ijma and Qiyas are dependent
upon it. That is why they cannot make a law against Quran. 

***Approval:***

The Holy Quran approves the use of Quran as a source in
the following words:
***"O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the messenger and those who are charged with authority among you and if you differ in anything amongst yourselves then refer it to Allah and His messenger if you believe in Allah and the last day"***

Here the phrase "obey Allah" refers to the orders of Allah laid down in the obedience in the Holy Quran.
