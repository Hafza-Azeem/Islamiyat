#### Q.How do Muslim scholars/Muslims use the Holy Quran as a source of Islamic Law/in Islamic Legal thinking/in making Islamic laws? [10] 18:40 (8laws).

***Introduction:***

The Holy Quran was revealed upon the Holy Prophet (PBUH) through angel Jibrael over a period of 23 years  (from 610-632AD). 

It is the first source of Islamic Law and is a primary source 

The Holy Quran is universal, eternal and for all times to come. It is a perfect divine book which will never be
changed as Allah himself has taken the responsibility to protect it as the Holy Quran says:
***"Surely We have revealed this reminder (The Holy Quran) and no doubt We will protect it (from corruption)."***

***Importance of The Holy Quran:***

Since the Holy Quran is the first and primary source of
Islamic Law, Muslims accept its teachings without
any doubt.

It is unchangable/unamendable due to its divine nature.

It guides. Muslims both individually and communally
complete code of life covering different aspects
for example religious, social, political, economic, military, Judicial etc as the Holy Quran says:
***"We have revealed to you (o Muhammad) the book (Holy Quran) an exposition of everything."***
 
The Holy Quran is an independent source whereas all
other Sources like hadith, Ijma and Qiyas are dependent
upon it. That is why they cannot make a law against Quran. 

***Approval:***

The Holy Quran approves the use of Quran as a source in
the following words:
***"O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the messenger and those who are charged with authority among you and if you differ in anything amongst yourselves then refer it to Allah and His messenger if you believe in Allah and the last day"***

Here the phrase "obey Allah" refers to the orders of Allah laid down in the obedience in the Holy Quran.

This verse also approves the use of hadith, lima and qiyas.

***Tafseer and Muffassir:***

Tafseer is the interpretation /explaination/clarification of the Holy Quran whereas Muffassir is the one who. interprets, explains or clarifies the Quran

Following the demise of the Holy Prophet (PBUH), Muslims felt that there was a need for the clarification of Quranic verses which were difficult to understand. Therefore the Science  of Tafseer was  discovered Muslims came to know that the best explaination of Quran was by the Quran itself for example Surah- al-Maidah verse 1 says:
***"Lawful to you are all beasts of cattle with the
exceptions named..."***
In this verse the the Quran  does not explain the exceptions the exceptions are not outlined but later in the third surah, Quran explains the exceptions are not verse of the same which the earlier verse was referring to This principle is called, Tafseer-al-Quran-bil-Quran (clarification of the Holy Quran by the Quran) 

Sometimes the Holy Quran is explained/clarified by the hadith of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) for example the method of prayer. This principle is called Tafseer-al- Quran- bil-hadith (clarification of Quran by the Holy Prophet (PBUH)).

***Examples of Islamic Law:***

***Law #1:***

The Holy Quran outlines the fulfillment of pillars of
Islam that are fasting, zakat, prayer etc. It says:
***"Establish a prayer and practise charity..."***
This verse orders the fulfillment of two faraiz namely
zakat and prayer which have to be fulfilled in order
to have a strong relationship with Allah.

***Law #2:***

The Holy Quran outlines the punishment of crimes like theft in the following words: 
***"For the theif. male or female cut off his or her hand"*** 
The reason for this apparently strict punishment is that a persons property is sacred and cannot be taken
without his or her permission.

***Law #3:***

Similarly the Holy Quran outlines the punishment of
adultery/fornication in following word:
***"Woman and man guilty of fornication, flog each of
them with a 100 strikes"***
This is because adultery is an immodest act whereas Islam promotes modesty and purity.

***Law #4:***

The Holy Quran explains the treatment of non-Muslims by
saying:
***"Let there be no compulsion in religion."***
Thus Muslims are ordered to respect other religions as Islam is a universal religion which respects the rights of every one.

***Law#5***

The Holy Quran ban's riba(interest on loan) in the following words:
***"Allah has allowed trade, but has forbidden riba"***
This is because riba is a way to exploit the weak conditions of the poor. 

***Law #6:***

Allah orders Muslim's to be most humble and polite towards their parents as they make maximum sacrifice for their children. The Holy Quran says:
***"And treat your parents with utmost kindness."***

***Law #7:***

The Quran promotes democracy as it says:
***"Who (the believers) decide their matters through mutual consultation"***
This shows that Islam promotes democracy and rejects.
dictatorship.

Law #8:
The Holy Quran orders Muslims to act respectfully.
especially in the presence of opposite genders. It says:

***"And say to the believing men;***

***To Lower their gaze and guard their modesty;***

***And say to the believing women;***

***To Lower their gaze and guard. their modesty."***

***Law #9:***

The Holy Quran tells Muslims about the division of
property of a deceased person among his children for
example for sons and daughters it says: 

***"The male should recieve a portion equal to that of two females;***

***If there are only daughters, two or more, they ***should."
recieve 2/3rd (two-third) of the inheritance;***

***If there is only one daughter, her share is half."***

Males have been given a greater portion than females
because they have to look after their family financially.

***Law #10:***

Allah orders Muslims to vage physical jihad against the
enemies of Islam and suppress their aggression as the Holy Quran says:

***"Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight you, but do not exceed Limits."***

***Law # 11:***

Islam stresses upon justice strictly even if it goes against a person himself or his family, as the Holy Quran says:
***"O you who believe! be staunch in justice as a witness to Allah even if it goes against you, your parents or nearest relatives..."***

This means that Islam promotes justice and condemns
favouritism.
