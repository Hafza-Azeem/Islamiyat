### Q. Explain the importance of Hajj for a Muslim. [4]

Haji is the 5th pillar of Islam and therefore obligatory on all rich Muslims. It is carried out in the month of
ZiL Hajj (twelfth month of lunar calendar) · Muslims are to perform Hajj atleast once in a lifetime Holy Quran says.
***"Pilgrimage to the house of Allah is a duty men owe to Allah, those who can afford the journey."***
Therefore when Muslims fulfill this obligation they come closer to Allah and earn his blessings.

It is a ritual which makes Muslims feel the
importance of life they have on this earth and the
afterlife by stripping away all markers of social
status, wealth and pride as in Hajj all are equal.

Hajj purifies Muslims from all sins as the Holy Quran says:
***"He who performs Hajj for Allah's pleasure and avoids all sins, will be returned after Hajj free from all sins as he was on the day his mother gave birth to him."***

### Q. Explain the comunal importance of Hajj [4]

Hajj is the 5th pillar of Islam and therefore
obligatory on all rich Muslims. It is
carried out in the month of Zilhaji which is the twelfth month of the Lunar once in a
calendar. Muslims must perform Hajj atleast
lifetime as the Holy Quran says:
***"Pilgrimage to the house of Allah is a duty men owe to Allah., those who can afford the
Journey."***
Therefore when 
Muslims gather in large numbers at and perform the same obligation it makes Muslims feel stronger as part of Muslim community that is
the Ummah. They also get to meet Muslims from all over the world and discuss problems and try to find solutions.

Hajj promotes equality as it removes.
social status, wealth and pride making all pilgrims appear equal, hence reducing all kinds of differences

Haji stresses upon unity within Muslims because
they all gather at one place at the same
and perform the same obligation which
promotes unity within the Muslims. Pilgrims
also get to meet Musl ims from different
corners of the world and also learn about the
problems facing the Muslim community and therefore
try to help them through cash and kind. This
promotes international brotherhood and harmony as
they act upon the Holy Prophet's saying...
***"None of you believes until he wants for his brother what he wants for himself."***

During the sermon of Arafat Muslims learn about
the rights of fellow beings especially about the rights of women as stressed upon by the Holy Prophet (PBUH) himself. Hence they promote
women rights and show acceptance towards females education, independence etc.
