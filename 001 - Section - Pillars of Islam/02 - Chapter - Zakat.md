### Q. Explain the importance of zakat for a muslim./[4]
A major pillar on which the structure of is stands is called zakat.Itcan be defined as a fixed proportion of one's wealth or possesion which is to be given to the poor after the completiomof a lunar year, Its improtance can be judged from the fact that the holy quran mentions it 32 times in the following word***"Establish prayer and practice charity."***

Hence when a muslim fulfills this pillar of islam,he/she shows obedience to the orders of Allah and earns His blessings,or comes closer to Him.

Zakat is also considered to be a blessing for both the giver and the receiver as the receivers financial problems are resolved/reduced and the giver earns the blessings of Allah and his wealth gets multiplied as the Holy Quran says:
***"By what which you layout for charity seeking the blessings of Allah will increase, it is those who will got recompense multiplied"***

(communal sentence):In this way the entire community gets the benefits of zakat.

Zakat helps purify ones wealth and also his heart from greed.As the holy Quran says:
***"Take(o Muhammad) from their wealth,a charity by which you purify them."***

### Q. Explain the communal importance of zakat. (4)

When zakat is practised on a on a larger scale throughout
Do not the Muslim world, it makes Muslims realize that
they are all one god's creation and part of a strong
mimi Muslin community that is the Ummah.

Furthermore when Muslims give a port of their
wealth to the poor, it reduces their financial
differences and therefore a bond of responsibility and
respect is formed between the rich and the poor
of which brings the society closer. The rich Muslims start
to see the poor as their brothers and come to realize that
in order to become true believers,they must sincerely and practically help those who need it. The Holy Prophet (PBUH) stressed upon this by saying:
***"None of you believes until he wants for his brother
is what he wants for himself."*** 

Since zakat provides the poor with financial security by
improving their living conditions. This reduces the crime.
rate in the society because through zakat the basic needs of
poor people are fulfilled they do not have to indulge in crimes like theft.

Zakat leads to equal distribution of wealth in the and society and prevents accumulation of wealth in so few hands so the
poor do not get poorer and the rich do not get richer therefore establishing a just and right balance between the two extremes.

It is also an an effective way to stimulate investments and discourage holding of wealth in the community because if the people do not invest their money, it would be gradually consumed by Zakat. Hence. this leads to rise in economic activities. The Holy Prophet (PBUH) has said:
"If  anyone of you is a guardian of an orphan who owns
wealth or possessions, he must trade (invest) with it and
not wait until Sadqah or zakat consumes it."
