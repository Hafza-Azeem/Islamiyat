Asr is the third prayer which is performed from afternoon(end of Zhr) until before sunset.Then Magrib is performed after sunset until complete darkness.Isha is the last prayer of the day and is performed from after complete darkness until fajr, however it is recommended to pray isha before midnight.

These prayers are performed at different times during a day so that a muslim remembers Allah and refrains from sins which displease him.As the holy quran says:"Allah has prescribe prayer upon the believers at its stated time."
### Preparations:
There are some specific preparations for prayers. Wudhu/Ablution(purification) is an important preparation for prayer.This involves the washing hands, face, arms feet etc. This is a traditional method,however in case of greater impurities ghusl to
he performed. Wudhu is very important as its importance has been laid down in the Holy Quran.
***"Oh you who believe! When you prepare for prayer,your face and hands up to the elbows, lightly your heads and wash.wash rub4 your feet up to the ankles."***

Wudhu is important as it is still performed if water is not available, which is known.I as purity is very important in
Tayammum (dryablution).Islam. The Holy Prophet (PBUH) has said
***"Clean Liness is half of faith."***
However there are other preparations such as place of worship 
and clothes should be clean. There is a proper dress code for prayer which is different for males and females for males it is to cover from the navel to the knee. For females it is to cover their entire bodies except for hands, face and feet.This teaches muslims modesty.

Finally one should face the Qibla which is the holy kaaba.As the Quran says:
***"Turn your faces in the direction of the sacred mosque where ever you are turn your face in that direction."***
 
Here the sacred mosque refers to the Holy Kaaba and
Muslims are to face in its direction while praying.
This highlights the importance of the Holy Kaaba
and emphasizes as the home of Allah.The importance of equality and discipline.Then you must say the Niyyat (intention). It is the state of heart. It can be either said out loud or
one's heart. The purpose of intentions is to focus
on worshipping and to forget about worldly and
materialistic activities.

I close all their business dealings and prepare for
prayer. As the Holy Quran says: "Oh you who believe I when the call is proclaimed for prayer on Friday, hasten earnestly to the
remembrance of Allah and leave off business.". This shows that its important for Muslims to stop working after 1st azoan to prepare for friday prayer.
### Preparation:
Its preparation includes taking bath (ghusl) following
the tradition of the Holy Prophet (PBUH). However
Wudhu can also be performed instead of ghust.

### Sermon:
After the second,the imam stands up on the pulpit facing the audience and delivers a sermon  in Arabic. This sermon has two parts. After delivering the first part, the Imam sits back for a while. Then he stands up again and delivers the second part of the sermon. The Friday sermon instructs Muslims to spend their lives according to Islam (Holy Quran and sunnah of the Holy Prophet PBUH). The Imam glorifies Allah and praises him emphasizung on Tauheed. He also praises the Prophet (PBUH) and sends blessings to him. In the sermon the Imam references from

He also warns them of the consequences of evil, thus reminding them of the here after.

It is necessary to remain silent during the sermon and listen to it attentively. Even durood cannot be recited. Therefore anything that can cause disturbance, e.g. mobiles have to be switched off. Then Muslims stand shoulder to shoulder in rows behind the Imam and offer 2 rakkat prayer.

This prayer takes place of the Zuhr prayer and instead.
of offering a rakaats, only 12 are offered. This prayer can
not be offered alone and cannot be offered as a delayed
prayer (Qaza) because of its congregational nature.

members of the community. They also discuss problems.
facing the community and find its solutions.

prayer.

### Explain the communal importance of friday congregational prayer. [4]

Friday prayer provides Muslim men an opportunity to get
together in one place and listen to the sermon of the
Imem. In this way, they become aware of the Islamic
teachings of the Holy Quran and Hadith, and also
understand the rights of fellow beings. In this way they.
start caring for eachother and become a better community
a whole.

It also provides Muslim, with an opportunity to disusss.
-problems and find their solutions. Hence when they help.
each other, this spreads brotherhood in the society as they
act upon the teaching of the Holy Prophet (PBUH):
"None of you believes, until he wants for his brother
what he wants for himself.".

Friday prayer Makes Muslims feel stronger as members.
of the Muslim community. When they see a large
number of Muslims attending the congregation they feel
proud to be part of the Muslim Ummah (community)
as they see the strength of Muslims in numbers.

Furthermore when Muslims stand shoulder to shoulder
for getting all social and economic differences, it
promotes equality and confirms that Allah wants
Muslims to be united under hy name.

### Q. Explain the communal importance of mosques. [4]
Mosques are a place of communal worship where Muslims
offer their Sprayers.

It is a place of sharing information, discussing problems
and finding their solutions.

It promotes peace and reduces all sorts of
differences.

It is place of learning/education where Muslims Learn
from the sermon of the Imam. It also has a madrasa which is a 
place for Learning as well. Muslims also learn
different aspects of Islam by discussing with fellow
Muslims.

Allah rewards Muslim 27 times more when they offer
in congregation at the mosque.
It also acts as a place of shelter for the victims of
natural catastrophies for e.g. Earth quakes, floods, and
even for the homeless.

The appearance of the mosque also suggests that
Allah wants Muslims to be united under His name.
as they stand shoulder to shoulder in a single hall
without! class difference.

### Q. Describe the conditions and methods of performing Wudhu.[10]

### Introduction:
Wudhu is the foremost preparation before prayer, and the
Holy Prophet's Sunnah gives us the details of the conditions
and methods of Wudhu.
### Conditions:
The conditions of Wudhu are that intention should be made,
the entire wudhu should be in a continuous process without
breaks. No parts should be allowed to dry before the
other is washed. 

It should be in a prescribed order.

Washing should start from the right side to the left parts should be left to dry.

No part should be left dry.

It is recommended to brush ones teeth or use miswak.

### Method 
Wash both hands up to the wrist
Gargle 3 times
 Sniff in water through the right hand and use the left to
clean the nose.

Wash the whole face using both hands from the forehead
to the chin and lobe of ear to the other.

Wash the right hand and then the left up to elbows.

Wet the hands and perform massah by wiping forth of the head.

 Both ears are cleaned from the inside to the outside.

Wudhu is very important as the Holy Quran mentions,
***"O you who believe! when you prepare for prayer, wash your face, and hands up to elbows lightly rub your heads,wash your feet uptil the ankles".***  

### Method of Prayer:

### Q. How do Muslims perform a single Rakat of prayer. [10]
##### 1. Takbir-e-Tehreema
##### 2. Qiyam
##### 3. Ruku
##### 4. Sajdaha

### 1.Takbir-e-Tehreema:
 The first thing we do when we start our Prayer
is Takbir-e-Tehreema.

In this we raise our hands up to our ears and say:
***"Allah is the greatest."***

This is done in a in the standing position

### 2. Qiyam
Then comes the Qiyam.

It's importance is that it marks the beginning of prayer.

In the standing position, the worshipper folds his hands
on his chest (females) and above the navel. (males) in such
manner that the right hand is above the left.

Now we recite thanna, Tawuz, Tasmiyyah

We then recite the first chapter of the Holy Quran.
i.e. Surah Fatiha.

In this surah we recognize Allah as the lord of the
universe, and the master of the day of Judgement.

Then we ask Allah to show us the straight path, the
path of those whom he has blessed and not of those
who have earned his anger or have gone astray.

After the completion of Surah Fatiha, other Surah from the Holy Quran, usually Surah Ikhlas or Surah Kawsar but we
can recite any three verses from the Holy Quran.

The importance of Qiyam is that it is obligatory and prayer is incomplete without it. 

Recitation of Surah ul Fatiha is also compulsory as
the Holy Prophet (PBUH) has said:
***"No Salah without Fatiha!"*** 
which means that the recitation of Surah fatiha is
absolutely mandatory

### 3. Ruku:
After saying, 
***"Allah is the greatest."***
The worshipper bends down with his back straight,
holding his knees in a tight manner. Now he/she
recites Tasbeeh-e-Ruku
***"Glory to my Lord the mighty."*** 
Three times

Then he stands up and while standing he recites:
***"Allah listens to him who praises Him."***
Then in the same position we praise Allah by saying!
"O my Lord! All praise are for you!"

The importance of Ruku is that it is a compulsory part of prayer.

It shows our dependence of Allah.

it removes arrogance and promotes modesty.

### 4. Sajdah: 
Now the worshipper says.
***"Allah is the Greatest."***
and performs sajdah.

In this he places his forehead, nose, palms of both
hands, his knees and his toes on the ground.

In this position he recites tasbeeh-e-Sajdah that is:
***"Glory to my Lord, the superior "***
 Three times
He then sits back for a while after saying:
***"Allah. is the greatest.".***
then goes back into sajdah by saying the same.

The short pause between the two sajdah called Jatsa

The importance of Sajdah is that it is obligatory and
shows our nothing ness before Allah as he is the
Creator and Sustainor of all His Creation.

This completes the first. Rakat.

Therefore we should offer salah at its stated time.

If a person does not offer it on purpose, he is sinful.

However! delayed prayer is also allowed in
some situations which shows the mercy of Allah as
Muslims provided with a second opportunity to gain reward.

Since Allah is Al-Rahman and AL-Raheem which symbolizes his mercifulness. Thus we should avoid punishment and try to please him, as he is entrusted in rewarding not punishing.

One of the Hadith-e-Qudsi Allah says:
***"Surely my mercy overcomes my wrath."***
Which shows that Allah is the most merciful and oft-forgiving as he loves his creation and gives then many chances.
