### Chapter 3: Fasting
### Q. how muslims fast in the month of Ramzan? [10]

***Introduction:***

Fasting is the third pillar of Islam and therefore
obligatory on all adult Muslims. The Holy Quran says.
***"0 you who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it
was prescribed to those before you, so you may learn
self-restraint and taqwa (fear of god)."***

Muslims fast in the month of Ramazan which is the
9th month of the Lunar Calendar.

***Sehri:***

Muslims start their fast with Sehri which is an eraly
morning meal. The Holy Prophet (PBUH) has said...
***"Take sehri as there is a blessing in it"***

This shows the importance of sehri as it provides
Muslims with enough energy to remain hungry and thirsty
throughout the days.

***Niyyat:*** 

Before the fast, Muslims make an intention and say.
***"I intend to keep tomorrows fast of Ramzan."***

***Timings:***

The timings of fast are the daylight hours from
dawn until dusk.

***Restrictions:***

During a fast, Muslims can not eat or drink anything.
Smoking or taking oral medicine is also prohibited. The
Holy Prophet (PBUH) has said that the one who indulges
in fighting or using abusive language, their fast will be
void. This means that the main purpose of fasting is to
teach patience, tolerance and modesty.


***Recommended Actions:*** 

On the other hand, Muslim's are encouraged to do such
acts that are acceptable to Allah. Therefore they
recite the Holy Quran more frequently as it was revealed.
in this month. 

They also visit the mosques more frequently for congregational
and individual prayer as they are aware of the greater
reward for every good action in the month of Ramzan.

Muslims are to live their lives in normal fashion and
not ask for concessions for example reducing workload.
or cutting short activities.

***Iftar:***

After sunset, Muslims break their fast by renting the
following dua:
***"O my Lord! I fasted for you, have faith in you, put my
trust in you and with the food you provided I break
my fast."***
                                                
 Them we break our
fast either with a date, a pinch, of salt or a glass of water as per the tradition of the Holy Prophet (PBUH).

Then Muslims offer their Maghrib prayer and have
dinner with family, or friends

***Taraweeh:***

After offering Isha Muslims offer a special prayer
known as Taraweeh. In this prayer Muslim's recute. the
Holy Quran if they are offering it alone, however if
they are offering it in congregation, they listen to
the recitation of Quran by the Imam.

***Aitikaf:***

During the last 10 days of Ramzan, many
Muslim males with draw to the mosque which is known as aitikaf
or retreat. In this way they fully concentrate on
worship by forgetting all worldly and materialistic
activities. Muslim women can do the same in their homes.

***Night of Power:***

In the last 5 odd nights, Muslims worship a lot searching
for Laylat-ul-Qadr (The Night of Power). It is the night of power
on which the Holy Quran was first revealed and the
Holy Prophet (PBUH) recieved his Prophethood. Therefore
this night has a very high reward.

The Holy Quran says that the worship on this night is
equal to the worship of a thousand months.

The mouth of ramazan comes to an end when the moon of shawal is spotted 

***People who are excused:***

However there are Some people who are fully excused
for example children, insane people and old people.

3. Islam and therefore obligatory on all adult Muslims
as the Holy Quran says:
***"Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed.

things, it develops patience, tolerance and modesty.

Muslims also recite the Holy Quran more frequently
as it was revealed in this month. They also offer
prayers in congregation at mosques, hence. trying to
earn more blessings / reward for every good act in the
month of Ramzan.

Q. Explain the communal importance of fasting. [4].
• When Muslims fast and remain hungry and thirsty
throughout the day, they realize the situation of their
poor brothers and feel sympathetic towards them.
Therefore they try to improve their lives through cash
and kind. In this way they act upon the Prophet's teachings:
"None of you believes until he wants for his brothers what
The wants for himself." rotantall & love.

• Fasting is practised on a larger scale throughout the
Muslim Ummah/world. Thus it makes Muslims realize that
