### Section 2: Articles of Faith
### Chapter 4: Predestination and Decree
#### Q. Outline the main features of Muslim belief in Allah's predestination and Decree. [10] Time:10:51

Introduction:
It is an article of faith as Iman-e-Muffasil says:
***"I believe in Allah and His 
angels and His books and His prophets and in the fact that all good and bad fate has been predecided by Allah and in resurrection (life after death)."***
This shows that believing in Allahs predestination and decree is imperative for Muslims other wise their faith would be incomplete and they would be out of
the fold of Islam.

***Allah's omni-potence / all powerfulness:***

Allah is omni-potent, he is the master, the creator and the cherisher of all mankind and everything that exists. He is supreme and has perfect control over everything. Ayat-ul-Kursi mentions Allahs omni-potence and His complete authority over everything.
by using the phrase: ***"His throne"*** which symbolizes His authority and power.

***Allah's omniscience/Allah is all knowing:***

Allah's knowledge is complete and perfect in
every aspect. He knows everything (the past,present, future).Ayat-ul-kursi mentions Allahs omniscience in the following words:
***"Nor shall they come pass any of his knowledge except as he wills"***

***Description:***

Everything has been predecided by Allah, even the
lives of people have been already decided.
JAVA. The Holy Quran says:
***"And remember when you met He showed them to
In you as few in your eyes And made you appear
contemptible in their eyes so that Allah might
accomplish a matter already decreed "***
This shows that the victory of Muslims in the Battle of Badr was predecided by Allah.

At another occasion the Holy Quran mentions
that the birth of Hazrat Isa (A.S) without a
father was predecided by Allah. Surah-al-Maryam
tells us that angel Jibrael appeared before
Hazrat Maryam and gave her the glad news
of the birth of a holy son without a father.She was shocked and asked the angel how it could be possible as she was unmarried, to which the angel replied: ***"It is a matter already decreed."***

Hence the lives of people, their birth, their
sustenance and even death has been pre decided by Allah.

***Freewill:***

Although Allah has predecided everything, He has
given men free will to decide different affairs of their life. 

Allah has created everything good/positive
all evil has been created by men
under the influence of satin.

It is our own freewill which will give us the
choice between right and wrong. Hence this
freewill allows us to choose between Allahs path
and the satinic path/ways for which we be answerable to Allah on the judgement

***Conclusion:***

This belief strengthens our faith in tauheed. It
also prepares us to face the difficulties of
Life with steadfastness and patience as
everything has been predecided by Allah.

#### Q. Explain the importance of this belief to modern Muslims. [4]

It is an article of faith as Iman-e- Muffasil says: ***"I believe in Allah and His angels and His books and His prophets and in the fact that
all good and bad fate has been predecided by Allah and in resurrection (life after death)."***
This shows that a modern Muslim knows that
without believing in predestination and decree
his faith would be incomplete and he
would be out of the fold of Islam.

This belief strengthens our faith in tauheed
all understand that Allah is powerful and all knowing. Therefore modem. Muslims become more careful and avoid shirk (associating partners with Allah) as a Muslim knows that Allah is watching him as He is All-Seeing and All-Hearing. Muslims know that they will be answerable to Allah on the day of judgement for the freewill that has been granted to them. Hence they become more careful and they do acts that please Allah for example following the pillars of Islam, fulfilling the rights of fellow beings and avoiding sins Like disrespecting parents and shirk.

This belief gives Muslims patience to bear the
hardships of life with stead fastness knowing that it was Allahs will which had been that it was predecided for example if a persons close relative passes away, they should be steadfast knowing that it was predecided by Allah.
