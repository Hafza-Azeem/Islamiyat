#### Q. Outline the main features of Muslim belief in  revealed books. [10]  19 mins
 
 ***Introduction:***

It is an article of faith as Iman-e-Muffasil says:
***"I believe in Allah and His angels and His books and His prophets and in the fact that all good and bad fate has been predecided by Allah and in resurrection (life after death)."***
This shows that belief in all revealed books is imperative for Muslims otherwise their faith would be incomplete and they would be out of the fold of Islam. 

The Holy Quran says:
***"It is righteousness to believe in Allah and His angels and His books and His prophets and in the Last day."***
This shows that believing in all revealed books is an act of piety.

***Description:***

Allah has sent revelations to His prophets throughout history for the guidance of mankind. These revelations were sent to prophets through angel Jibrael.

 All these books contained 3 basic teachings:

1. Tauheed (oneness of Allah):

All these books taught the mankind that Allah one. He is the creator, cherisher and sustainor everything that exists. His creation does not have any physical relation with him, hence rejecting shirk
(associating partners with Allah) as it is
unpardonable sin.

2. Belief in articles of faith.

These books taught us that angels and prophets are the messengers of Allah and do not have
physical relationship with him. They also taught us that this life is temporary and will come to an one day. However, there is a permanent Life and before entering into it we will be resurrected to give an account of their deeds of this world to Allah who is the master of the
day of judgement He will then either bless us with paradise or punish us in hell.

3. Morality:

The books taught people about morality, conduct and justice as the Holy Quran says:
***"Certainly! We have sent the messengers with clear arguments And have sent down with them the book and the balance so that men might practise Justice."***
 
The revelations were the best way in which Allah communicated His will to the people. These revelations were then compiled into a book.

These books were sent for specific nations except for the Holy Quran which is universal and for all times to come. However these nations corrupted their messages and therefore there was a need
for a fresh and pure message after some time Examples:
The Holy Quran mentions that there were many prophets who were blessed with revelations /books/ scriptures however it names only the following.

1. Zaboor to Hazrat Dawood (A.S)

2. Torait to Hazrat Musa (A.S).
 
3. Bible/ Gospel/Injeel to Hazrat Isa 
(A.S)

4. As the Holy Quran says:
***"And before it, there was the book of Moses (Torait) as guidance and mercy"***

As the Holy Quran says:
***"We gave him (Jesus) the bible, where in there is guidance and light it confirms torait that was sent before it"***

4. The Holy Quran to the Holy Prophet (PBUH) as the Holy Quran says:
***"And we have revealed to you (O Muhammad) the book (The Holy Quran) as an exposition of everything."***

5. Suhufe-Ibrahim to Hazrat Ibrahim (A.S)"

These books were revealed in the language of their people as the Holy Quran says:
***"We did not send an apostle but with the language of his people, so that he may explain to them clearly"***

Features of the Holy Quran:
The Holy Quran is the last divine book which was revealed upon the Holy Prophet (PBUH) in a period of 23 years from 610 to 632 AD.

It  a complete code life which covers all aspects for example social, economic, political, military judicial etc.

It contains the same teachings of the previous books (tauheed, articles of faith, morality) however the Holy
Quran is universal and for all times to come.

Holy Quran is in a Living Language that is Arabic. unlike previous scriptures whose Languages have been forgotten.

It is perfect and will never be changed as
Allah himself has taken the responsibility to protect it
as the Holy Quran says:
***"Surely we have revealed this reminder (Holy Quran) and no doubt we will protect it (from corruption)."***

The Holy Quran sums up the teachings of all previous scriptures as there will be no need for any divine book after it since Islam is the Last religion of Allah as the Holy Quran says:
***"This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed my favours upon you and have chosen for you Islam as your religion."***

### Q. Explain the importance of this belief to modern Muslims. [4]

It is an article of faith as iman-e-Muffasil says:
***"I believe in Allah and His angel's and
His books."***
This shows that a modern Muslim knows that
de without believing in all revealed books their faith would be incomplete and they would be out the fold of Islam. 

When modern Muslims believe in all revealed books including the bible (the book of Christians) and torait (the book of Jews) they come closer to non-Muslims (Christians and Jews) which promotes universal brotherhood and religious harmony.


All these books conveyed the same message of Tauheed (oneness of Allah) hence strengthening faith in they try to avoid shirk (associating partners with Allah) as it is an un pardonable sin.

These books conveyed Allahs will to mankind therefore they should follow the message of the right path conveyed in these books and become pious 

#### Q. Explain the relationship between angels, prophets and revealed books. [4].

Belief in all 3 is an article of faith as Iman-e-Muffasil says:
***"I believe in Allah and His angels and. His books and His prophets and in the fact that all good and bad fate has been predecided by Allah and in resurrection (life after death)."***

which shows that it is imperative to believe in all 3 otherwise our faith would be incomplete and we would be out of the fold of Islam

There are 3 processes involved in a revelation. Firstly Allah conveys his revelation to angel Jibrael
who then convey's it to the prophet and then the prophets convey those revelations to the people these revelations were compiled into a
book form-for example Allah conveyed the revelations to angel Jibrael who then revealed those revelations upon the Prophet (PBUH) and he (PBUH)
then conveyed those revelations to his people. After his death these revelations were compiled into the Holy Quran.

Angels and prophets are the creation of Allah but do not have any physical relationship with him. Such teachings are mentioned in the Holy books.
