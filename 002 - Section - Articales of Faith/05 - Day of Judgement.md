### Section 2: Articles of Faith
### Chapter 5: Day of Judgement
#### Q. Outline the main features of Muslim belief in the day of judgement/resurrection and life after death. [10]
Introduction:
It is an article of faith as Iman-e-Muffasil says:
***"I believe in Allah and His angels and His books and His prophets and in the fact that all good and bad fate has been predecided by Allah and in resurrection (life after death)"***
This shows that believing in judgement / resurrection is imperative for  Muslims otherwise their faith would be incomplete and they would be out of the fold of Islam.

The Holy Quran
says:
***"It is righteousness to believe in Allah and His angels and His books and His prophets and in the last day"***
This shows that believing in Day of judgement/resurrection and life after death is an act of piety.

Description:
Muslims believe that this life is temporary and will come to an end one day. Then people will be resurrected to give an account of their deeds of this world to Allah who is the of the day of judgement master
The Holy Quran says:
***"Every soul shall have the taste of death in the end to us shall you be brought back"***

The life of this world finishes with death and then a lesser Judgement takes place when the two angels Munkir and Nakin question the dead.

The soul will remain in Barzakh (a barrier) until the day of judgement as the holy Quran says:
***"And infront of them there is a barrier (Barzakh) till the day when they will be resurrected."***

***First Trumpet:*** 

The end of time will begin when the angel
will blow the first trumpet. All livings will die and everything will be destroyed for example mountains will be floating etc
as the Holy Quran says:

***"The Calamity;***

***what is the Calamity?;***

***And what do you know what the Calamity is?;***

***It is s day when men will be like scattered moths;***

***And mountains will be like carded wool."***

The celestial bodies like the sun, stars etc will be eliminated due to the horror of that day. The Holy Quran says:

***"When the sun is folded up;***

***when the stars fall losing their 
luster;***

***when mountains vanish..."***

At another place the holy quran describes the scene of that day in the following words:

***"And when the sky is split open;***

***when the stars fall scattering;***

***When the seas are flowed away."***

This shows that the entire universe will come to an end after the first trumpet.

***Second Trumpet:***

Then the angel Israfeel will blow the secondtrumpet and people will be resurrected to give an account of their deeds as the Holy Quran says:

***"And on that day will all men come forward;***

***Separated from eachother;***

***To be shown their past records..."***

All mankind will gather in Allah's court which Muslims believe to be plains of Arafat.

They will be given the record of their deeds. Even the slightest good or bad will be measured as the Holy Quran says:

***"So he, who has done an atom's weight of good shall see it;***

***And he, who has done atom's weight of evil shall see it."***

The righteous people will, their records in their right hands and they will be rejoicing. The sinners will recieve their records in their left hands or from behind their backs and they will be upset.

Some of them will ask for a second chance
but Allah will refuse

People will not be in a position to deny divine justice as even their body parts will testify against them.

The pious ones who lived their lives according to the orders of Allah, will be blessed with paradise,(place of permanent bliss, happiness and pleasure).

The sinners who disobeyed Allah will be punished in hell (a place of permanent pain, torture and agony).

The Holy Quran mentions this in following words:

***"So he whose scale of good deeds will be heavier;***

***He will be in a life of permanent pleasure;***

***And he whose scale of good deeds will be lighter;***

***He will be thrown in a bottomless pit;***

***And what do you know what it is?;*** 

***it is an a fire blazing fiercely."***


***Conclusion:***

This belief is important as it not only gives meaning to this worldly life but also makes us responsible because we know that we have to give an account of whatever we do in this world to Allah in the here after as the Holy Prophet (PBUH) has said:
***"This world is a cultivating ground for the here-after"***

### Q. Explain the importance of this belief to modern Muslims. [4]

It is an article of faith as Iman-e-Muffasil says:
***"I believe in Allah and His angels and His books and His prophets and in the fact that all good and bad fate has been predecided by Allah and in resurrection (life after death)."***

This shows that a modern Muslim knows that
without believing in the day of judgement / resurrection and Life after death his faith would be incomplete and he would be out of the fold of Islam.

This belief gives meaning to our worldly life as we know that whatever we do in this Life, we will be held accountable for it on the day of judgement. Hence a modern Muslim becomes more responsible in his everyday life and tries to do
more good deeds that are acceptable to
Allah for example following the pillars of Islam and avoids sins Like disrespecting parents and shirk.

This belief those who gives hope to those who are physically and financially handicapped for example blind by birth or are living in poverty. When they believe in the Last day and life after death, they believe that Allah will compensate them. These people are then thankful for what they have not complain. Similarly, those and they do who have been physically and financially blessed by Allah should stay humble and not consider themselves superior as all of it is
a test from Allah. These people should help those who are handicapped to earn
Allahs blessings.
