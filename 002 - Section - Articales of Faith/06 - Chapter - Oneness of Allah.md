### Chapter 6: Oneness of Allah

#### Q. Outline the main features of Muslim belief in oneness of Allah. [10]

***Introduction:***

It is an article of faith as Iman-e-Muffasil says: 
****"I believe in Allah and His angels and His Books and His prophets and in the fact that all good and bad fate has been predecided by Allah and in resurrection (life after death)."***
This shows that belief in oneness of Allah is imperative  for Muslims otherwise their faith would be incomplete and they would be out of the fold of Islam.

The Holy Quran says:..
***"It is righteousness to believe in
Allah and His angels and His books and His prophets and in the last day"***
This shows that believing in oneness
of Allah is an act of piety.

***Description:***

Muslims believe that there is only One God
who is the Creator Cherisher
and Sustainor of the everything  that exists in universe.

A person enters the fold of Islam by reciting Kalima-e-Tauheed which says:
***"There is no God but Allah and Muhammad (PBUH) is His Last messenger."***

Surah-al-Baqarah mentions Allah's unity
in the following words:
***"Your God is only One God;***

***There is no God but He;***

***The most Gracious;***

***The most Merciful."***

***Surah Ikhlas:***

The most comprehensive passage regarding Allah's unity and oneness is Surah Ikhlas which says:

***"Say, He is Allah, the One and only;***

***Allah, the Eternal, the absolute;***

***He begets not, nor is He begotten;***

***And there is none Like Him ."***

This means that Allah is one without any hint of plurality.

He is Everliving and will never die.

He is not bound to time as He is from eternity to eternity. 

He is infinite and Limitless.

He is absolute (independent) whereas His creation is dependent upon Him.

He does not have any physical relationship with any of His
creation for example prophets, angels.


•He does not need a successor.

Allah is beyond human comprehension and He can not be compared to any of His creation.

***Allahs Creative Powers:***

Allah is the creator of everything for example man, jin, angels etc.

The Holy Quran mentions Allah's creative powers in the following words:

***"Read! In the name of your Lord, who created;***

***Created man out of a mere clot of congealed blood."***

Similarly the Holy Quran mentions:
***"Praise be to Allah, the creator of the heavens and the earth who created angels as messengers that have wings 2,3,4."***

***Allah's Existence:***

There are clear proofs of Allah's existence all around us for example the flawless and the well guarded heavens that have been raised without any pillars
The earth that has been spread out Like a
carpet for the benefit of mankind.
The celestial bodies like sun, stars, moon etc. are all signs of Allahs existence. Similarly the mountains,
oceans, clouds, sustainance like fruits, vegetables, crops are all signs of Allahs existence.

The Holy Quran says:

***"Who (Allah) made the earth a
vesting place for you and the heavens, a canopy and sent down rain from the heavens;***

***through it brought forth fruits as sustenance for you;***

***so do not  associate partners with Allah while you know."***

***Master of The Day of Judgement:***

Allah has the power and authority to create, destroy and recreate. for example Allah has created the celestial bodies but will destroy them at the end of time as the Holy Quran says:

***"When the sun is folded up;***

***when the stars fall losing their 
luster;***

***when mountains vanish..."***

At another place the Holy Quran says:

***"When the sky is split open;***

***when the stars fall scattering;***

***When the seas are flowed away..."***

However Allah will resurrect men
and in on the day of judgement to give an account of their deeds of this world to Allah who is the master of the day of judgement as mentioned by the Holy Quran


***Surah Fatiha:***

***"Praise be to Allah;***

***Master of the worlds;***

***The Most Gracious;***

***The Most Merciful;***

***Master of the day of judgement..."***

At another place the Holy Quran mentions:

***"Every soul shall have a taste of death;***

***In the end to Us shall you be brought back."***

This shows that Allah is the master of the day of judgement who will resurrect people and accordingly. bless them with paradise or punish them in hell.

This also means that Allah is not only the creator of this temporary world but also the creator of the hereafter (permanent world).

***Allahs Knowledge:***

Allah has perfect knowledge of everything He knows the past, the present and the future as the Holy Quran says:

***"He (Allah) knows what has happened before us and what will happen after us."***

***Tauheed:***

Tauheed has 3 aspects:

1. Unique in person:

This means that Allah is the only God and no one has share in divinity. as the Holy Quran says:
***"Do not take two gods as there is only one God."***

2. Unique in Attributes:

This means that Allah's attributes are the most perfect and our qualities cannot be compared to His for example, although we can hear and see but these qualities of our depend upon our organs and are very Limited. However Allah is All-Hearing and ALL-Seeing which means that He hears and sees everything without any douth.

3. unique in actions:

This means that Allah's actions are the most perfect and cannot be performed with
the same level of perfection by his creation for example Allah created man out of nothing and will resurrect His creation on the day of judgement. Similarly He the Holy Prophet (PBUH) on the journey of Mairaj when time was stopped, which cannot be understood by us

Belief in tauheed is important as it makes us broadminded and independent to explore as we know that nothing in this world is God.

***Shirk (associating partners with Allah):***

Shirk has 3 aspects:

1. Shirk in person:
When it is believed that there are many gods for example the belief of polytheists, or that there is no
god for example the belief of atheists.

2. Shirk in attributes:

When it is believed that someone or
has qualities similar to Allah.

3. Shirk in Actions:

when it is believed that someone
or Something can perform the actions that can only be performed by Allah.

Shirk is an unpardonable sin
as Holy Quran says:
***"Allah does not forgive associating partners with Him,
but forgives everything else to whom He pleases."***

The Holy Prophet (PBUH) has said..
"Shirk is the greatest of all sins. Hence man should avoid shirk and worship Allah
alone"

#### Q. How does belief in Tauheed influence the everyday life of a modern muslim? [4]
OR

### Q. explain the improtance of belief in tauheed for a modern muslim? [4]

It is an article of faith as Iman-e-Muffasil says: 
****"I believe in Allah and His angels and His Books and His prophets and in the fact that all good and bad fate has been predecided by Allah and in resurrection (life after death)."***
This shows that a modern muslim knows that without believing in tauheed his faith would be incomplete and he would be out of the fold of Islam.

Allah is All-Hearing and ALL-Seeing therefore a modern Muslim becomes more responsible in his everyday life and tries to do more good deeds that are acceptable to Allah for example following the pillars of Islam and avoids sins Like disrespecting parents and shirk.

It makes us modest and humble as we know that everything we own is a blessing of Allah. Therefore we do not consider ourselves superior to others as we know that we will be held accountable on the day of judgement for everything we have.
