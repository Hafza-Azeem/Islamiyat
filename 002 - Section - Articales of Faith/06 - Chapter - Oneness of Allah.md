### Section 2: Articles of Faith
### Chapter 6: Oneness of Allah

#### Q. Outline the main features of Muslim belief in oneness of Allah. [10]

***Introduction:***

It is an article of faith as Iman-e-Muffasil says: 
****"I believe in Allah and His angels and His Books and His prophets and in the fact that all good and bad fate has been predecided by Allah and in resurrection (life after death)."***
This shows that belief in oneness of Allah is imperative  for Muslims otherwise their faith would be incomplete and they would be out of the fold of Islam.

The Holy Quran says:..
***"It is righteousness to believe in
Allah and His angels and His books and His prophets and in the last day"***
This shows that believing in oneness
of Allah is an act of piety.

***Description:***

Muslims believe that there is only One God
who is the Creator Cherisher
and Sustainor of the everything  that exists in universe.

A person enters the fold of Islam by reciting Kalima-e-Tauheed which says:
***"There is no God but Allah and Muhammad (PBUH) is His Last messenger."***

Surah-al-Baqarah mentions Allah's unity
in the following words:
***"Your God is only One God;***

***There is no God but He;***

***The most Gracious;***

***The most Merciful."***

***Surah Ikhlas:***

The most comprehensive passage regarding Allah's unity and oneness is Surah Ikhlas which says:

***"Say, He is Allah, the One and only;***

***Allah, the Eternal, the absolute;***

***He begets not, nor is He begotten;***

***And there is none Like Him ."***

This means that Allah is one without any hint of plurality.

He is Everliving and will never die.

He is not bound to time as He is from eternity to eternity. 

He is infinite and Limitless.
