### Chapter 2: Prophets

#### Q. Outline the main features of muslims belief in prophets? [10]

***Introduction***

It is an artical of faith as imaan-e-Muffasil says:***"I believe in Allah and His Angels and His Books and His Prophets and in the fact that all good and bad fate has been decided by Allah and in Resurrection and Life After Death"***
This means that believing in prophets is imperative. for Muslims otherwise their faith would be incomplete and they would be out of the fold of Islam.

The Holy Quran says:
***"It is righteousness to believe in Allah and His angels and his books and His Prophets and in the Last Day."*** This shows that believing in prophets is an
act of piety.

***Description:***

Allah has sent prophets throughout history. Their chain started with Hazrat Adam (A.S) an ended with the Holy Prophet (PBUH)

They were all sent for the guidance of mankind and were themselves guided by Allah through Angel Jibrael

They all chosen by Allah and they them selves had no part in this choice. For example  Hazrat Musa (A:S) saw a fires on The Mount of
Tur and went there to collect it as it was and winter season. However he found out that it was a spiritual fire through which Allah talked
to him directly and blessed him with prophethood.This event shows that Hazrat Musa (A.S) was unaware that he would be chosen as prophet

They were all men sinless and had the best moral characters.

They were all sent to specific nations (except for the Holy Prophet whose prophethood is universal). These nations corrupted their message
so there was a need for a fresh and
pure message after some time.

They all conveyed the same message which had 3 aspects: 

***1.Tauheed (oneness of Allah):***

They all taught that Allah is one
the creator, cherisher and sustainor of all His creation. His creation does not have any physical
relationship with Him. These prophets also forbade their people from committing shirk (associating
partners with Allah)

***2. Day of judgement & life after death:***

They all informed their people that this life
is temporary which will come to an end one
The day However, there is another life which is
permanent and before entering into it we will
be resurrected to give an account of our deeds
of this world to Allah who will either bless
with paradise or punish us in hell.

***3. Morality code of conduct:***

They asked their people to improve their moral
characters for example refrain from sins like
lying cheating or backbiting to become better
human beings

Example:
Some prophets were given books:

1. Hazrat Dawood (A.S) was given Zaboor.

2. Hazrat Musa (A.S) was given Torait

3. Hazrat Isa (A.S) was given Bible/Gospel/Ingeel

4. Holy Prophet (PBUH) was given Quran.

Some prophets were given scrolls/suhufs for
example Suhuf-e-Ibrahim

They were given miracles are sign of their
their prophethood, eg Hazrat Musa was given
stick which could change into a snake under Allah's orders. Similarly, Hazrat Isa (A.S) could resurrect the dead, heal the blind etc.

According to the tradition of the Holy
Prophet (PBUH) there were 124,000 prophets however the Quran names only a few for example Hazrat Yusuf, Hazrat Yaqub, Hazrat
Younus etc.

They all spoke the language of their people
and the message they recieved was also in the
same Language so that they could understand and
act upon it as the Holy Quran says:
***"We did not send an apostle but with the language of his people, so that he might
explain to them clearly."***

Muslims respect all prophets equally as Quran says: ***"They (the believers) say: 'We do not differentiate of His prophets.'***

***Types of Prophets:*** 

•Prophets are categorised into 2 types ie. Rasul
and Nabi. Rasul was a prophet who was
divine Law/shariat whereas,prophet who continued to preach divine Law / shariat brought by previous prophet for example Hazrat Musa was a rasul as he was given a new divine
Law (Torait) whereas his brother Hazrat
Haroon was a Nabi as he preached the Same message
of Hazrat Musa.

***Features of the Holy Prophet (PBUH):***

The Holy Prophet (PBUH) is the last prophet of
 Allah and there will be no prophet after him.
He brought the same message as of previous
prophets however his message is for the entire
mankind and for all times to come as the
Holy Prophet (PBUH) has said: ***" I have been sent as mercy for the entire mankind"***

He is the apex of humanity as he possessed
the best moral character. The Holy Quran says:
***"Indeed, you have in the apostle of Allah, a
beautiful pattern of conduct."***

He was blessed with the Holy Quran which is
the last universal and eternal divine book. It
will never be changed as Allah Himself has
taken. the responsibility to protect it. The Holy
Quran says:
***"Surely we have revealed this reminder (the Holy Quran) and no doubt we will protect it (from
corruption)."***
Therefore the Holy Prophet summed up the teachings
of all previous prophets.

The Holy Quran says in this regard.
***"Muhammad is not the father of any of your men
but he is the messenger of Allah and the seal
of Prophets."***

So the Holy Prophet is the last prophet of Allah
and Allah completed the religion of Islam through
him as the Holy Quran says:
***"This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed my favours upon you and have
chosen for you, Islam as your religion."***
