### Chapter 1: Belief in Angels.

#### Q. Outline the main features of Muslim belief in Angels. [10] Time: 16:56

***Introduction:***

It is an article of faith as Iman-e- Muffasil says:
***"I believe in Allah and His Angels and His Books and His Prophets and in the fact that all good and bad fate has been
decided by Allah and in Resurrection and
Life After Death."***
This means that believing in angels is imperative. for Muslims otherwise their faith would be incomplete and they would be out of the fold of Islam.

The Holy Quran says:
***"It is righteousness to believe in Allah and His angels and his books and His Prophets and in the Last Day."*** This shows that believing in angels is an
act of piety.

***Description:***

Angel's are made up of light and are invisible.They are the creation of Allah but do not have any physical relationship with him. In this way Islam condemns the belief of such people who
say that angels are the daughters
of Allah. As Surah Ikhlas says:
***"He (Allah) is neither a father nor a son.".***

Angels are gender less. They do not have any
physical requirements for example food or sleep.

They do not have free will which means that
don't they don't have a choice between right and
wrong so they will not be held accountable on
the day of judgement by Allah. This also means
that they can not a quire knowledge as they
only know what Allah wants them to know.

They are countless in number and have longer
lives than humans but they are still mortal as
they will die before the end of time.

Angels prostrated before Hazrat Adam under
Allah's orders which shows that humans are
superior to the angels.

They helped Muslims in different battles for
example the Battle of Badr as the Holy.
Quran says:
***"When you sought the help of your Lord, He
replied: I will assisst you with
a thousand angels ranks upon ranks"***

They have wings as the Holy Quran says:
***"Praise be to Allah, Creator of the Heavens and the Earth who made Angels that have wings
2,3,4..."***

A tradition of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) states that
Angel Jibrael had 2oo wings.
They are larger in size than humans for example
when Prophet (PBUH) came of the Cave of Hira, he
saw Angel Jibrael covering the entire horizon.

They purified the heart of Holy Prophet (PBUH) 
twice in his lifetime. Firstly when he was four years
old and in the custody of Hazrat Halimah Sadia, and secondly 
before the journey
of Mairaj.

Examples:

There are some specific angles with specific duties:
There are four arch angels which are as follows:

1. Angel Jibrael (A.S):

He is the Arch-Angel (Head of Angels / Chief)

He brought revelations to the Prophets including
the Holy Prophet (PBUH).

He appeared before Hazrat Maryam (A.S) to give
her the glad news of the birth of a Holy son
(Hazrat Isa) without a father.

He along with the angel of mountains appeared
before the Holy Prophet (PBUH). after the incident
of Taif and asked for the permission of Holy
Prophet (PBUH) to destroy the city of Taif
however the Holy Prophet (PBUH) forgave them by
saying:
***"I have been mankind sent as mercy for the entire"***

He accompanied the Holy Prophet (PBUH) on the
Journey of Mairaj.
He along with other angels descend upon
earth on the Night of Power as the Holy Quran says:
***"The angels and the spirit (Jibrael) descend in it (The Night of Power) by the permission of their Lord to fulfill all affairs."***

2. Angel Israfeel.

He will blow a trumpet at the end of time.
After the first trumpet, all livings will die
whereas after the second trumpet everyone will
be recurrected and gathered in the court of
Allah to give an account of their deeds on
the day of judgement.

3. Angel Israel:

He is the angel of death.

4. Angel Mikaeel:

He is the angel of rain, food and celestial bodies.
(sun, moon,stars etc).

There are some other angels as well:

5. The Two angels Kiram-un-Katibin:

They are the Holy recorders who record all
good and bad deeds as the Holy Quran says:
***"Surely there are keepers over you; the honourable recorders; they know what you do."***

6. Mun kir Nakir:

They will question the dead

7. Malik and Rizwan:

They are the custodians of hell and paradise

***Conclusion:***

Allah says in the Holy Quran that the
enemy of angels is the enemy of Allah
as the Holy Quran Says:
***"Whoever is the enemy of Allah and His angels and Jibrael and Mikaeel, and His prophets then indeed Allah is the enemy of disbelievers"

This shows that for being a good Muslim;
belief in angels is important.

Q. Explain the importance of belief in angel's modern Muslim. [4]

                                OR
                                
Q. How does Muslim belief in everyday life? [4] 

It is an artical of faith as Iman-e-Muffasil says: . ***"I believe in Allah and his angels..."*** This shows that a modern Muslim knows that
without believing in angels, their faith would be incomplete
and they would be out of the fold of Islam.

Muslims believe in Kiram-un-Katibin (Holy
recorders) knowing that they write everything we
do, hence we become more responsible and careful in our every day life for example we
try to do more good deeds that are acceptable to Allah Like following the pillars.
of Islam and fulfilling rights of fellow beings and also avoid sins like disrespecting parents and shirk.

Angels are the creation of Allah which strengthens our belief in Allah's creative powers as he created different creations like
jins, angels, humans etc. Therefore we believe in Allahs Omni-potence in a more stead fast manner.

Angels pray for the forgiveness of believers which
shows that. Allah is loving and forgiving as his
mercy is far more than his wrath. In one of the
Hadith-e-Qudsi Allah says: 
***"Surely my mercy overcomes my wrath.".***

Belief in angel Israel and Israfeel strengthens
our belief in death, and life after death which
makes us even more responsible and careful.
