### Chapter 1: Belief in Angels.

#### Q. Outline the main features of Muslim belief in Angels. [10] Time: 16:56

***Introduction:***

It is an article of faith as Iman-e- Muffasil says:
***"I believe in Allah and His Angels and His Books and His Prophets and in the fact that all good and bad fate has been
decided by Allah and in Resurrection and
Life After Death."***
This means that believing in angels is imperative. for Muslims otherwise their faith would be incomplete and they would be out of the fold of Islam.

The Holy Quran says:
***"It is righteousness to believe in Allah and His angels and his books and His Prophets and in the Last Day."*** This shows that believing in angels is an
act of piety.

***Description:***

Angel's are made up of light and are invisible.They are the creation of Allah but do not have any physical relationship with him. In this way Islam condemns the belief of such people who
say that angels are the daughters
of Allah. As Surah Ikhlas says:
***"He (Allah) is neither a father nor a son.".***

Angels are gender less. They do not have any
physical requirements for example food or sleep.

They do not have free will which means that
don't they don't have a choice between right and
wrong so they will not be held accountable on
the day of judgement by Allah. This also means
that they can not a quire knowledge as they
only know what Allah wants them to know.

They are countless in number and have longer
lives than humans but they are still mortal as
they will die before the end of time.

Angels prostrated before Hazrat Adam under
Allah's orders which shows that humans are
superior to the angels.

They helped Muslims in different battles for
example the Battle of Badr as the Holy.
Quran says:
***"When you sought the help of your Lord, He
replied: I will assisst you with
a thousand angels ranks upon ranks"***
